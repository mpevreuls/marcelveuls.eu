### My story

<p>To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering  **all** . It is probably my age. I was born in the early seventies in a very small village in the eastern part of the Netherlands. During my early childhood we moved a arround a lot within the Netherlands. At the end of primary school we settled again back in the eastern part of the Netherlands (Achterhoek). Until my 17th birthday i grew up and worked on a chicken farm. Went to school, mud-raced cars and visited hardrock concerts with my Friends. </p><p>Then i left home and went to Maastricht to study Economics and Information Resource Management. During my studies i worked as a taxi driver and waiter in a restaurant in Valkenburg. After my studies i started working my first job in Amsterdam and moved arround in the Netherlands, UK, France and Dubai until 2003. More details you can find on my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/marcelvreuls/">Linkedin Profile</a>.</p> <p>In 2003 my first Daughter was born and i needed to settle down. More kids followed and together with my Wife we had 5 kids, multiple dogs and started breeding our dogs in 2014. Currently happily maried, living in Germany and working at a company in the Waste Industry and Circulair Economy.</p><p>There is a lot more to tell....but that is not for the internet.</p>
